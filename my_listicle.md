# The Listicle

## Games:

*The sites of various games I used to enjoy a lot, and still do; The ones here were just chosen as not everyone would consider them.*

1. **[Flashpoint Archive](https://flashpointarchive.org/)** - A long-standing archival project that hosts many beloved Flash games, past their presumed extinction by Adobe. I wasn't exactly in the 'flash generation', the likes of which Newgrounds and its kind were sort of the capital, but I did play their games quite a bit.
2. **[Hero Interactive](https://www.herointeractive.com)** - A dead company that created games for flash; Theirs were among the best I knew, an appraisal that was common to their playerbase, though there were not that many of them. (Bubble tanks, anyone?)
3. **[Nitrome](https://www.nitrome.com)** - A somewhat more alive flash game group, who actually denied the Flashpoint people permission to archive their games on the program; However, these games in question are still very much playable on their own site.

## Art Tools:

*A number of programs I used to develop art, of a couple different kinds. Usually I use one tool for each.*

- **[G.I.M.P.](https://www.gimp.org/)** - A free art program, similar to Photoshop, albeit somewhat less robust. Still, it has allowed me to make many images I can be proud of, though their exact nature may not have ever employed the program to its fullest.
- **[SketchUp Make 2017](https://download.cnet.com/sketchup-make-2017/3000-6677_4-10257337.html)** - A 3D modeling program, distinct from most others in its emphasis on ease of access, though evidently at the cost of traditional functionality. I have taken the time to learn its ins and outs, in order to be able to use it as I would most other 3d modeling programs (but again, my skills may not exactly push the limits).
- **[Online Sequencer](https://onlinesequencer.net/)** - A website that allows you to compose digital music directly in your browser, replete with numerous functions that you might need to do things like... Take your compositions to a platform with better instrumentation. I used to write music with this site, but I found that I didn't really like what I ended up making very much.
